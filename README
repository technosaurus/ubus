Specification and wtf this is:
   read specification.txt

C bindings and binary:
   If your unix has select(3)  just type "make"
   if it doesn't, implement the two missing bits in lib/ubus.c and send me a patch ;)
   or specify -DNO_SELECT
   See some fun examples in examples/*  that use the C select api.
